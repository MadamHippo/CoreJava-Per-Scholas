You can use the throw statement to throw an exception manually. The general format of the
throw statement is as follows:

throw new ExceptionType(MessageString);

The throw statement causes an exception object to be created and thrown. In this general
format, ExceptionType is an exception class name and MessageString is an optional String
argument passed to the exception object’s constructor. The MessageString argument contains a custom error message that can be retrieved from the exception object’s getMessage
method. If you do not pass a message to the constructor, the exception will have a null
message. Here is an example of a throw statement:
throw new Exception("Out of fuel");
